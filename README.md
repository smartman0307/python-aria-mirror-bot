- DOWNLOAD_DIR : The path to the local folder where the downloads should be downloaded to
- DOWNLOAD_STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL : A short interval of time in seconds after which the Mirror progress message is updated. (I recommend to keep it 5 seconds at least)  
- OWNER_ID : The Telegram user ID (not username) of the owner of the bot
- AUTO_DELETE_MESSAGE_DURATION : Interval of time (in seconds), after which the bot deletes it's message (and command message) which is expected to be viewed instantly. Note: Set to -1 to never automatically delete messages

```
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```
